# Fandango_project

The project is based on the numeric and star rating of movies. Fandango helps to look at the rating as well as book the tickets for movies at the same time.
It was suspected that Fandango provides fake ratings that does not match the actual ratings so as to sell more tickets.
To check the same, data of 2015 is collected related to movies with their ratings and is compared with the ratings of Fandango.

Graphs related to the same are plotted for better results using Machine Learning.
The graphs are plotted using matplotlib and seaborn.

The final result of the project shows that Fandango had different ratings as compared to actual ratings and difference is also calculated.
